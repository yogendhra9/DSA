## Daily Progress Log

### Day 1 Progress
**Date**: 12/06/25

**Time Spent**: _____ hours

**Problems Completed**: ___/5

**Key Insights**: 
- Bottom line: for = predictable iteration, while = conditional/multiple operations
- For loop to drive the right variable and while to shrink the window(Variable sized problems)
- 
**Struggles**: 
- During the calculation of subarray size of problem 2 considered k instead of n-k+1
- Made a mistake in the logic of expanding the window by using while loop without handling the increment properly `while(r < arr.length-1)` it should be `for(r=0;r<n;r++)` as we are drving the right pointer.
